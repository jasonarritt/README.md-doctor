  ## Installation
  At this time, installation requires a user to clone the README.md-doctor repository to their local machine and using Node to run index.js ("node index.js").
  ## Usage
  When README.md Doctor is initialized the user will be prompted with a series of questions to collect information related to the application for which they are generating the README.md file. Upon completing the questionnaire a professional README.md file will be generated. The user can then retrieve this README.md file, edit it as needed and use it for their application.
